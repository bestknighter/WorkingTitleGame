#Working Title
######A game still in development made by a developer who are still figuring out how to implement some stuff

Yeah, that's pretty much it.

I'm creating a game for the Game Genre Development class I'm taking at Lawrence Technological University and the working title of it is Working Title and it's an incomplete game about an incomplete game being tested by some smartass player playing as a smartass tester.
